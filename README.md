## 🛠️ Introduction
Welcome to zkir-llvm! This software allows you to convert programs written in any LLVM-supported language, such as Rust, C, C++, or Go, into bytecode. This bytecode is specifically designed for zero-knowledge proof generation. Zero-knowledge proofs let you verify data without revealing the data itself, making this tool valuable for privacy-focused applications.
